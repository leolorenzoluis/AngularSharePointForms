# Angular SharePoint Forms
Inspired by [ShockoutForms](https://github.com/jbonfardeci/ShockoutForms), SharePoint 2010 Angular Forms.

```
Forget the frustrations of legacy InfoPath and XSL SharePoint form development. 
Leverage the power of Knockout's databinding plus SharePoint's REST
services to create modern and truly dynamic web forms.
```

But instead of using Knockout.js, the idea of the project was to use Angular 1.x with SharePoint 2010.
